# Contributing Guidelines [![jaywcjlove/sb](https://jaywcjlove.github.io/sb/lang/chinese.svg)](contributing-cn.md)

## Add Projects
1. Fork the repository.
2. Add your section - make sure you follow the styling guide below.
3. Commit changes.
4. Push your commit.
5. Create a Pull Request.

### Styling

- Use `###` headers for your sections.
<!-- - Also use `###` for categories (these should group together relevant sections) and `####` for subcategories. -->
- Capitalize the project name.
- In the headers, append `![stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/:user/:repo.svg) ![last update](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/:user/:repo.svg)` to show the last update time and stars of the project.
- Add a link to your section/category to the contents section (use relative links).
- Make sure to include examples wherever possible (preferably GIFs) and brief introduction to the project.
- For command-line examples, wrap your commands in a `bash` code block.
- At the end of your section, add a `Read more about...` link. This should directly link to [Git's](http://git-scm.com/docs), [GitHub's](https://help.github.com), or the relevant documentation.
- Make sure your grammar is correct and there is no typo.
- If your contribution is a translation, add a (relative) link to the README above the [Table of Contents](readme.md#table-of-contents).
